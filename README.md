# BotBuddy üöóüîß

BotBuddy is a remote-controlled tank platform developed to explore embedded systems, motor control, and wireless communication. Built from the ground up in 2023, this project integrates real-time control, sensor feedback, and a mobile input interface to create a responsive robotics experience.

## Features

- üéÆ **Remote Control**: Receives movement commands via Bluetooth from a custom mobile controller interface.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Motor Control**: Dual motor setup for differential steering using PWM signals.
- üîã **Battery Powered**: Runs on an onboard power supply for wireless mobility.
- üß≠ **Sensor Integration (optional)**: Designed to support distance sensing and obstacle avoidance (planned for expansion).

## Technical Stack

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino UNO (or ESP32 if applicable)
- **Control Interface**: Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05 or BLE)
- **Programming Language**: C++ (Arduino Framework)
- **Motors**: DC motors with L298N motor driver
- **Chassis**: Custom or kit-based tracked tank platform

## Project Goals

- Learn real-time embedded control and motor driving principles
- Implement reliable Bluetooth communication for remote operation
- Design a functional robotic base for future autonomous features

## Future Enhancements

- Add ultrasonic sensors for object detection and avoidance
- Incorporate a camera module for FPV streaming
- Upgrade to Wi-Fi-based remote control and web dashboard
